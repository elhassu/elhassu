- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @elhassu. Name's Keelan but most call me Hassu, I go by either.
- ðŸ–¤ My passion is front-end development, my aim is to create beautiful front-end applications that every user will fall in love with.
- ðŸ’» I'm fluent in a number of programming languages, JavaScript has to be my favourite!
- ðŸŽµ Music has to be one of my greatest motivators, I believe the emotions you experience whilst doing anything will be greatly influenced by the music you're listening to at the moment.
- ðŸ‘Ÿ Keeping fit is also a great priority for me whether the diet you're currently on or a fitness plan you're following, strong body - strong mind!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m improving on my skills day by day, always seeking for the most efficient & effective outcomes.
